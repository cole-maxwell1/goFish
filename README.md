# Go Fish!!!
This is a project that two partners and I worked on for our `Data Suctures` class final project. It is a basic command line app where a player
interacts with three other bots to play a game of go fish. We used the Java `ArrayList` to store player *hand* information and to store player objects in the game.
During this project we also explored the uses of `enum` to create unique types for each suit (King, Queen, etc...)
